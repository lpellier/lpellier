# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Lucas Pellier, a **22** years old student at `42` School.
I've entered the school in October 2019 and have since then completed the **Common Core**.

I am currently looking for a 6-months internship in **Web Development**.
My most notable web projects are `ft_transcendence` and `portfoliOS`. They were both built with **React** in **Typescript**.

I have a passion for **programming** (especially web development) and **videogames**.
